        College is overwhelming. It's easy to lose yourself and feel unmotivated. 
        During these times, it's nice to have a supportive friend group that can 
        help get you back on your feet. Unfortunately, campuses are gaining more 
        and more students, which makes forming friendships a dreadful experience.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        The first place to look would be the various clubs and organizations on 
        campus. However, even the number of clubs can be abundant, which can be 
        intimidating at times.

        <div>
        Colleges need a centralized platform for clubs and organizations to 
        reach out to students in order to promote their events. In turn, this 
        would enable students to foster a social, helpful network of friends.

          That's where my team and I come in! We developed an iOS mobile application 
          called Social University Platform (SUP for short) which allows students to 
          stay connected with each other and the events going on around campus. 
          It also allows them to form groups to keep track of deadlines/responsibilities.

          This project began in one of my classes, where students form teams of 10

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section__title">A Rough Start</h2>
        <div>
        What brought me here was the Early Research Scholars Program at UC San Diego. 
        I applied for this program at the end of my freshman year, when I was still 
        scared of getting lost on campus! It was one of the greatest decisions of my 
        college career because it was an enlightening research experience.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        Through an in depth process of defining a problem, reading research articles, 
        ideation, and testing with users, we were able to create a small game about 
        statement coverage. The game consisted of a few gamification techniques that 
        were rated to be the most effective, to name a few: reward system, progression, feedback.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        My contribution spanned across game design, sound design, level design, 
        ecording meeting notes, and user testing.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        Given the time frame of the program, our initial game was purely on the terminal. 
        However, it didn't really look like a game, and we decided that it just wasn't 
        practical enough to get decent data.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        We shifted toward a game with a better GUI and developed it with Unity and C#. 
        There was definitely a time crunch, but we managed to pull it off! Through several 
        intermediate user testing, we improved our game slowly, changing color 
        schemes, sounds, and graphics. Here is the final version of our game.

        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        To test the effectiveness of our game, we had to conduct surveys where participants played both 
        the gamified version and non-gamified version of the program. The reason we had to create a 
        non-gamified version was because we needed a control for our experiment that at least in the 
        same scope as our game (we just took out a few gamification features)

        Users stated that the game introduced a sense of urgency with understanding 
        the concept, which made them focus and try harder. This was due to the fact 
        that they had a health bar and they could lose the game if their inputs 
        weren't good enough.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        Users admitted that they were more engaged from the gamification aspects, 
        but the animations and sounds could be distracting at times. It was important 
        to find a good balance between engagement and learnability.

        The metrics we decided to measure for success were met, leading us to

        <h2 class="section__title">Reflection</h2>
        <div>
        Before my research, I was just as guilty as everyone else when it came 
        to testing my code. However, during our problem definition phase I 
        learned so much about the dangers of faulty software. I believe 
        gamification is a great tool to help motivate students to learn software 
        esting techniques. We definitely need a more polished product with a few 
        years of development, but I think it's a great start!
