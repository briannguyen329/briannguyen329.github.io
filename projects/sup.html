        College is overwhelming. It's easy to lose yourself and feel unmotivated. 
        During these times, it's nice to have a supportive friend group that can 
        help get you back on your feet. Unfortunately, campuses are gaining more 
        and more students, which makes forming friendships a dreadful experience.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        The first place to look would be the various clubs and organizations on 
        campus. However, even the number of clubs can be abundant, which can be 
        intimidating at times.

        <div>
        Colleges need a centralized platform for clubs and organizations to 
        reach out to students in order to promote their events. In turn, this 
        would enable students to foster a social, helpful network of friends.

          <div>
          That's where my team and I come in! We developed an iOS mobile application 
          called Social University Platform (SUP for short) which allows students to 
          stay connected with each other and the events going on around campus. 
          It also allows them to form groups to keep track of deadlines/responsibilities.
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph__spacing">
          This project began in one of my classes, where students form teams of 10 
          to simulate what itâ€™s like to work in the industry. This case study 
          documents how it all transpired and what I learned from this experience.

        <div>
        This was a huge project taking place during the early stages of the 
        pandemic, and we were very disorganized at the beginning. Meetings 
        were difficult to arrange because so many students were moving around 
        and settling in at home because campus was closed.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        We also had problems deciding the roles for each person, and there was a 
        dispute over who would be the project manager. To resolve the problem of 
        assigning roles, we let those who really wanted a role speak up first. 
        Then we began asking for volunteers. However, when it got to the 'Project 
        Manager' role, about three people wanted the role, which was dealt with by 
        a majority-ruled voting session.  Fortunately, everyone got a role they 
        were satisfied with. Even though this was a 10-week class, we probably 
        didn't properly start till Week 2.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        I learned from this experience that cohesion is an important factor in 
        the success of any team. Members need to be on the same page and each 
        one must be motivated to work together and compromise.

        The first few weeks were spent drafting use cases, user stories, and 
        ifferent drafts of our screen designs (see attached documents below). 
        After we decided on the technologies (React and Firebase) and the 
        initial design of the application, we finally began coding around Week 5/6.

        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        Although we were a little pressured on time at the end, without the 
        effort put into preparing all these materials, we wouldn't have been 
        able to stay on track.

        I never realized how dynamic a project could be! Everyday there were 
        problems, with either quick or hard fixes. Team members constantly 
        brought up great points about the product, making us rethink our design 
        and functionality.

        We shifted toward a game with a better GUI and developed it with Unity and C#. 
        There was definitely a time crunch, but we managed to pull it off! Through several 
        intermediate user testing, we improved our game slowly, changing color 
        schemes, sounds, and graphics. Here is the final version of our game.

        To test the effectiveness of our game, we had to conduct surveys where participants played both 
        the gamified version and non-gamified version of the program. The reason we had to create a 
        non-gamified version was because we needed a control for our experiment that at least in the 
        same scope as our game (we just took out a few gamification features)

        Users stated that the game introduced a sense of urgency with understanding 
        the concept, which made them focus and try harder. This was due to the fact 
        that they had a health bar and they could lose the game if their inputs 
        weren't good enough.

        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        Users admitted that they were more engaged from the gamification aspects, 
        but the animations and sounds could be distracting at times. It was important 
        to find a good balance between engagement and learnability.

        <div>
        Before my research, I was just as guilty as everyone else when it came 
        to testing my code. However, during our problem definition phase I 
        learned so much about the dangers of faulty software. I believe 
        gamification is a great tool to help motivate students to learn software 
        esting techniques. We definitely need a more polished product with a few 
        years of development, but I think it's a great start!
