        <div>
        I've been using all sorts of different technology since I was born, 
        which is probably why my eyesight is so poor. Unfortunately, because I 
        rely on a vast range of software and hardware for my personal and 
        professional life, I've grown accustomed to programs, games, and 
        applications running smoothly. However, we both know that this is 
        rarely the case! Many people experience glitches or bugs in their 
        software, with not a clue on how to fix them.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        Although they may be minor inconveniences to our daily lives, bugs 
        in code can be extremely dangerous elsewhere. For example, 
        faulty software used in airplanes or banks can cause tragic accidents 
        or dangerous data leaks. Here's exactly where the problem lies... why
        do we have to deal with these bugs at all?

        <h2 class="section__title">The Problem</h2>
        <div>
        Here's the catch. We shouldn't have to! The importance of testing our
        code is not emphasized enough in both the industry and in coding 
        courses. In fact, research has shown that many professional programmers 
        find testing to be “trivial and uninteresting”. How can we improve the 
        quality of our code by effectively testing it before it's placed into 
        the market? Like most things, a great idea is to tackle it at the source
        : education.

      <!-- A Solution -->

        <div>
        We can utilize gamification to keep students engaged and motivated 
        when learning about software testing techniques, which will result 
        in better programmers, reducing the amount of bugs in our software.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        To narrow our scope, we first focused on a specific sector of software 
        testing before branching out. We chose to gamify statement coverage.

        What brought me here was the Early Research Scholars Program at UC San Diego. 
        I applied for this program at the end of my freshman year, when I was still 
        scared of getting lost on campus! It was one of the greatest decisions of my 
        college career because it was an enlightening research experience.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        Through an in depth process of defining a problem, reading research articles, 
        ideation, and testing with users, we were able to create a small game about 
        statement coverage. The game consisted of a few gamification techniques that 
        were rated to be the most effective, to name a few: reward system, progression, feedback.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        My contribution spanned across game design, sound design, level design, 
        ecording meeting notes, and user testing.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        Given the time frame of the program, our initial game was purely on the terminal. 
        However, it didn't really look like a game, and we decided that it just wasn't 
        practical enough to get decent data.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        We shifted toward a game with a better GUI and developed it with Unity and C#. 
        There was definitely a time crunch, but we managed to pull it off! Through several 
        intermediate user testing, we improved our game slowly, changing color 
        schemes, sounds, and graphics. Here is the final version of our game.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph__spacing">
        To test the effectiveness of our game, we had to conduct surveys where participants played both 
        the gamified version and non-gamified version of the program. The reason we had to create a 
        non-gamified version was because we needed a control for our experiment that at least in the 
        same scope as our game (we just took out a few gamification features)
